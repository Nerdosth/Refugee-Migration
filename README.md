Project 4:

Team 00: 

Team Members:   Rahma Ali, Nicholas Erdos-Thayer, Chris Schultz,  Art Rogers


Project Proposal:

We plan to analyze state level data made available by the UN Refugee Agency, UNHCR. In our analysis we hope to learn migration flows from other countries into the US and summarize the reasons on the migration and we hope to use machine learning to predict future refugee numbers.

 

Data Sources:

The UN Refugee Agency collects data on refugee’s around the world - https://www.unhcr.org/refugee-statistics/download/?url=Kg1Mg6

Uppsala Conflict Data Program - Department of Peace and Conflict Research - https://ucdp.uu.se/

Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters - https://www.emdat.be/

About Dataset

UN Refugee Agency, UNHCR


 Machine Learning Goal - Input Feature (select from dropdown, for example), export a prediction output. (API) 
	
 # Data Cleaning
 The data cleaning process involved identifying missing data, correcting inconsistencies, removing duplicates, irrelevant data, standardizing and scaling the data. The resulting cleaned dataset was suitable for further analysis and can be used to gain insights into the patterns, trends and future prediction of refugee migration.
 
 #  Database
4 tables were created using  SQLite database. The table names are as follow:

#### 1. Table 1 -Demographic_ml
#### 2. Table 2 – Event_ml
#### 3. Table 3- Cleaned_conflict
#### 4. Table 4 –Cleaned_disasters
